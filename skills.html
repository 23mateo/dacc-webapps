            <p class="text" style="font-family: verdana;">Welcome to my skills page, this page covers everything that I will be learning while in my application development class. I've been in this class for about one week so far, and we're currently learning how to code HTML, this site is actually my first project, which you can find more information about on my projects page. We currently have a very basic knowlege of HTML (which is probably pretty obvious from the website), and are also learning style sheets. We will most definetly cover more than just these two topics while at the career center, such as learning to work with Unity, as well as Javascript and C#. I'll update this page as we continue to learn more skills throughout the year, thanks for reading. :)</p>
            <div style="font-size: x-large;">MORE TO COME SOON!</div> <br><br><br>
