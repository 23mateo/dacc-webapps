            <p class="text" style="font-family: verdana;"> Welcome to the feedback page, this is where you can type out whatever you want and instantly email it to me! It definetly works and does not send you to a fake site that will hopefully convince you that the message was actually submitted instead of being trashed. PS: Don't write anything too long, I wouldn't want it to get deleted and not sent to anyone, not like that would ever happen though. :)</p>
