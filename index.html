    Hello, my name is Mateo Mora, welcome to my first website. I designed and created this website as my first project in my Application Development class. I enrolled to take this class at the Delaware Career Center in the mornings I'd typically attend school. I wanted to take the app development program because I want to pursue a career in game design and or development. I think that learing to code in any capacity will give me a large advantage in college. At the highschool that I go to, which is Thomas Worthington High School, I currently attend 3 classes this semester. Those 3 classes are College Credit Plus Pre-Calculus, Forensics Science, and AP Language.
