                Hello, my name is Mateo Mora, welcome to my first website. I designed and created this website as my first project in my Application Development class. I enrolled to take this class at the Delaware Area Career Center (which you can learn more about <a class="dacclink" href="https://www.delawareareacc.org/" target="_blank">here</a>) in the mornings I'd typically attend school. I wanted to take the app development program because I want to pursue a career in game design/development, and I can't wait to work <a class="gamelink" style=text-decoration:none  href="games.html">among</a> my peers! I think that learning to code in any capacity will give me a large advantage in college. At the highschool that I go to, which is Thomas Worthington High School, I currently attend 3 classes this semester. Those 3 classes are College Credit Plus Pre-Calculus, Forensics Science, and AP Language Arts. A little about me: I have one brother, Miguel, as well as 2 dogs (Coco, Mabel) and 2 cats (Ella and Greg). I enjoy playing videogames and going creeking, below I've attached some pictures of my pets (and cat2.jpg). Thanks for reading.
